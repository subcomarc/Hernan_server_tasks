I focused on remembering the 10 point shapes both positive and negative. This worked for the most part however occasionally they would not have the same value as previously.

make sure to avoid the negative 10s and always click the positive 10s any 0s or 1s have a negligible impact in the gran scheme of things.

To determine the symbol that will leave me with the most points, I tried a couple of different strategies. To start, I attempted to find patterns in the shapes. This did not prove to be too successful. Instead, I focused on colours and found patterns and commonalities in what the colours meant. For example, I selected mostly cold colours and soon learned that this was a positive way to proceed. Some sets did not align with this tactic, for example, when one shape was black and the other was light pink. In this scenario, I learned that the light pink shape always yielded more points so noted this and proceeded accordingly. It is recommended that you try to establish patters with the colours.","15:47:08"

Each value is measured in points, your job is to collect the highest number of points possible, but be careful some of the symbol values take negative points which will reduce your overall score. 

You will notice, as you make your way through the rounds, that some repeating symbols are more likely to carry the same value as they have done previously, while others are randomly generated. 

Some are more likely to yield a higher point value. 

Some symbols are more likely to carry a lower value, so beware as these symbols will reduce your overall score. 

There is a strategy to this game, to notice the patterns of values attached to each symbol and to base your decision on this. If a symbol had a high point value, do you trust and believe it will have the same point value the next time you see it? Trust your instinct, and your gut and remember that the point of this game is to collect the highest number of points.

It is quite a lot of information at once, so my best advice is to focus on the pairings with the biggest wins and losses first. Really try to remember what the points changing was. So you can make the best decision. And just guess on the small change options. This will help you make the most points and avoid losing the most points.

Each shape/colour appears to have a set value - but only when paired with a certain colour and if it is left or right - like a combination of the side/pattern/colour &amp; partner shape - designates points for these.

This didn't appear to always be constant however. But I did realise there seemed to be a &quot;starting pair&quot; that it came round to again at the start of each &quot;cycle&quot; - what appeared to happen was on the first pair if left or right was the &quot;winner&quot; - if you stick with that side until the next cycle the win/losses appear to add up to a net gain.

You may wish to develop a strategy for choosing symbols. It may be your preference to choose symbols based on how bold (intense) their colour is; or you may want to choose symbols that resemble real-world items, structures, or faces. Looking for a pattern in your choice of symbols is a perfectly valid way of deciding which to choose. If your intial strategy doesn't work out, and you aren't gaining that many points - don't worry! Some rounds, one symbol may be worth lots of points, or both symbols may be worth the same amount (so whatever you choose you will receive the same amount of points as you would have if you had chosen the other symbol).

I started clicking on the left. I received positive amounts, 0p (or the same negative amount as the right hand side) for approximately five clicks. Once my left-hand amount became a lesser value than the right-hand side, I changed and clicked the right-hand side. When this side's value became the lowest, I then switched back to the left and continued in this way.
   I did perhaps become aware that when -10p appeared, if I changed sides this resulted in a lower amount, so I stayed with the -10p side as my next click until the higher value amount appeared on the opposite side again. This was the only pattern that I thought I found and it only happened when -10p appeared.","16:13:29"
"645bee4a288a06ce3029b198","645bee4a288a06ce3029b198","TEACH_RL_TEACHER_NoReversal","There is a finite (small - maybe 10) set of patterns and you will see a great number of pairs (maybe 50). Because of this, the pairs will repeat frequently. 
There does not appear to be any determination of how much an individual symbol is worth (e.g. colour, number of pixels, generalised shape). The value of each symbol can change.
However, it appears that for any given pair of symbols you will be shown, the values of both will always be the same - the value offered may well relate to some unknown relation between the two or it may just be a result of that pair being together. It is not clear if the symbol appearing on the left or right of a pair makes any difference.
If you simply write down which values are offered by each pair, you will see that pair many times, and you should be able to make the best choice. This means that without figuring out the relationship, the first time you see a pair, you will have 50% chance of winning by guessing, then after that 100% chance of winning with that pair.","16:15:46"

I found that this usually gave me the most amount of points, however if you see a trend that i missed follow it. ","16:17:39"

In order to help you score as much as possible I will highlight the things I witnessed when I played the game myself. When you are choosing left or right object throughout the game either left or right will contain more minus point options. For me choosing the right option was the least punishing of the two as you could have as much as minus 10 points taken from you. Shape combinations also make a difference, you will see the same shape combinations multiple times and the amounts of points minus or plus were fairly consistant. So learn which was more lucrative when being paired with a certain shape combination. Sometimes the shape combinations will be the same but the side of which they appeared will be different either left or right. I found this did not have much a difference on the payout of either of the shapes more the combination of shapes and how they were paired. Colour combination may also have something to do with the order of what you are being payed. I found that a lot of the shades were similar colours just different shades of each colour, this may also be worth looking at. That is all I could observe whilst doing it, good luck to you.","16:23:24"

Try to remember the ones that have the biggest positive numbers and choose them. Also remember the symbols that have the biggest negative number, -10p and avoid them at all costs.","16:24:41"

The shapes don't give any clues to which amount of value you will get. It could be a good idea to guess on each set of shapes. It will be a good experience to follow what you think is the best option on each set.","16:40:28"

2) You will be asked to pick one of the symbols.
3) After you have picked a symbol you will be shown it's value.These can be 10p,1p, 0p, -1p or -10p.
4) Your task is to consistently pick the symbol you think will provide the highest value. 
5) The values change each time, but one of the symbols will USUALLY give a higher or even result. Be aware that occasionally it can be lower, though not often.
6) I recommend using a pen and paper to note which of each pair gave the higher result (you can ignore even results). After a few rounds you will spot a pattern emerge of which symbol of the pair tends to be higher.

EXAMPLE:
 If the pair of symbols are two different colours, say brown and green write down 'Brown' and then 'H' next to it if had the highest value and L if it was the lowest. Do this for each different pairing until you spot the pattern of which tends to be higher.","16:41:38"

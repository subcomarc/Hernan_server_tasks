I managed an okay score of 102 by following a pretty straightforward strategy while trying a few different things in the process to hopefully come up with a concrete strategy for you.

First of all, I believe the colours and shapes are assigned their values completely randomly. Colour, shape etc are random, so don't let a smiley face trick you into thinking it will provide positive points!

The best way to gain consistent points is by identifying the highest positive and negative tiles. Once they've been identified, the others will have little effect. For me, these were +10 and -10.

Once you've identified make sure you click/don't click them on each round.

The trickiest part is that the values for each pair of cards switch every now and then. I tried to figure out how often this happens but failed to, perhaps you could be more successful?

Importantly, I still gained a positive score by nearly always clicking my +10 tile while trying to predict when the values would switch.

Good luck!","16:11:53"

Best case scenario it will give 10 and worst case it will give nothing. There were 2 symbols that yielded -10 points and they were vaguely related to being on the left or right position. Avoid these as soon as you see a -10 appear from the symbol as the best result from these is simply 0. The other set of symbols don't matter as much as they seem to yield either 1 or -1 point so experiment to see which one is better. Try and deduce the relationships of the -10 symbols to their positions as soon as you can to mitigate the losses as the +10 is an easy point maker every time it appears.

Two different shapes of different colours will appear side by side, you choose one. There is a finite amount of variations of colour and shape (approx 8-10) you will cycle through, and each different shape remains the same colour throughout.
When the two shapes appear side by side on the screen, they tend to show up in the same pairs, so try to remember which of these had the better score, and it mostly seems to stay that way throughout.

I think your best chance is to test each shape, and then stick to one that is often a high value point. One that is consistently a negative point, choose the opposite.

These pairs are fixed i.e. a particular symbol will always be shown with the same alternative symbol. You choose a symbol to click on to win points.You don't win or lose the same amount of points each time because the outcome of clicking on the symbol depends on probability. So some symbols that you click on will have a high probability of giving you points so you will get points nearly every time you click on it and only rarely get no points or negative points. Other symbols may mostly lose you points or gain you points some of the time but not every time. You only find out the points you gain from the symbol you have clicked on and not its counterpart. I therefore recommend at the start that you regularly try changing which symbol you click on in each pair and try to remember which one more consistently gives you positive points. Once you have figured out which one gives you positive points more often than not, keep clicking on that symbol each time it appears in its pair consistently. ","16:22:55"

I also noticed that if there are big gaps inside the shape, these tended to perform better than those that were predominantly blocks (with one or two squares missing).

The same sequences and pairs of symbols also appear repeatedly throughout the test and when a pair of symbols is shown, their values appear consistent throughout the test e.g. if you see a blue symbol on the left and a green symbol on the right, and you click the left blue symbol and find it's worth 10p, the next time you see the same combination, the left blue symbol should also still be worth the same i.e. 10p.

Initially, I recommend clicking on a color you haven't clicked on before, then writing down the pair of colors and the value that was shown. Next time this combination is shown, click on the other color and record its value. 

Once you have been through all of the combinations at least twice, you should know which colors / symbols to click each time to get the highest score.

When clicking on a symbol the game will show you the value for the symbol you clicked, but not for the other symbol. This will just show as a ?

I would spend at least 4 rounds recording what each symbol pays out. In my name I opened up a simple notepad and made a name for each symbol based on what they looked like. Example:

Purple Floating Magnet  - Green Butterfly 

After each selection I recorded the results from the selections.

Purple Floating Magnet (10p,10p,10p,10p,10p,10) - Green Butterfly (0,0)

As you can see the the purple floating magnet paid out 10p most of the time so I kept selecting that one. 

There are some symbols in the pay that will consistently pay out a positive value and others that will consistently pay out a negative value or consistently pay out nothing.

Purple Space Raider (1p,0p,0) - U (0p,0p,0)

In these cases I randomly selected one of the symbols. 

There are also symbols pairs that will result in a negative payment, with these it's a case of selecting the one that you think will provide the least amount of negative value, which will take away from your overall points. 

For example:

Also its possible that brightly coloured symbols tend to carry more points than dark coloured symbols.

You will receive the number of points associated with the icon you select. You will see how many points you receive but will not see how many points the other icon was worth. Some icons are worth negative points. 
The icon that will give you the most points in a pair appears to stay the same, so trial and error should enable you to discover which icon in a given pair will be associated with the most points. Icons are presented in the same pairs (as far as I can ascertain) although they may be shown on different sides of the screen, so when you know how many points an icon is associated with when it appears, this should be the same each time it appears in the same place.  Icon values range through -10p, -1p, 0p, 1p and 10p. Good luck!  ","16:35:35"
"667eb020a3f04ab26214dcd4","667eb020a3f04ab26214dcd4","TEACH_RL_TEACHER_NoReversal_Pa","First thing's first - try to find the symbol that awards you 10p - this will give you the most points. Once you've found that, always click this.

It will, on occasion, drop to 0p, but then it will jump back to 10p again. 

Otherwise try to minimize losses by, where possible, avoiding those that make you lose points (i.e. -10p or -1p). 

Don't panic if the score suddenly changes, it's a one-off. Stick to the strategy and you'll end up with a positive result in the end.

You might be forced into a situation where you cannot avoid losing points, but that's OK, just trust the process.

There is no apparent link between colour, squares, spacing, etc, so don't go looking for this. Also don't fret if you aren't doing well. The side on which the symbol is placed also seemed to make no difference. 

Don't click randomly or quickly as this will just result in a poor performance. 

If you spot a pattern then stick with it! There may be something different in your game. 

Good luck!","16:36:59"

Now don't disregard no points as they are obviously still a better option than negative points. Just because a symbol gives points, it does not mean that it will give points again. It depends on the scenario, such as the position of the symbol (left or right) or what it comes after. So do not just go with a symbol because it gave you points the last time, pay attention and look at the details I have mentioned previously. At first you may lose points just trying to see what symbols give what points.","16:38:34"

I really did not have any strategy at all. Click through the pattern. As you do so, see if you can recognise a pattern. I finished with -19.
I did think the more space inside the shape, the higher the points. See how you get on.
My advice would be click what you like. Have fun. Take the cash!

Each symbol has a probability of producing an outcome when clicked. Outcomes are positive or negative.

The set repeats itself from time to time but gives different results. You might be lucky to get the same results twice from choosing the same symbol twice. Remember there are negative results and positive results and zeros as well. the more you get the positive results the higher the earnings and the more negative results gives you a lower earning. You might have to capture the symbols in your mind to make it easy to identify them on other appearances. Try to get more of 10s and 1s than that of the -10s and -1s. This will help you achieve more earnings and will make you enjoy the game so well. In making your choices, don't be in a rush to choose. Be calm in making selection of any symbol. You can equally be calculating your earnings to help you know weather you are winning or losing. An example is winning to 10s and another one -10. This means you are left with 10 so you would have start paying close attention to the next game and be smart in your next selection. Symbols might get you a bit confused from the start but with being attentive you will get to know them off-head. This is simple and easy to make your earnings go higher. Once again, you pay attention to the symbols being paired, check your winning and losing points and make sure you are calculating as well. Take your time in making your selections and will be a winner at the end of it all. GOOD LUCK.","16:56:48"
"5d3e38942c7ff0000126781d","5d3e38942c7ff0000126781d","TEACH_RL_TEACHER_NoReversal_Pa","The goal of this game is to select symbols which will maximize your total rewards. Some symbols will give you positive points, others will give you negative points, while some will give you zero points. Each symbol has a range of points they can give you statistically, so a symbol might give you 10 points say 75% of the time, but 0 points 10% of the time and -5 points 15% of the time. However, since you can't see the points that clicking on the other symbol gives you, it makes figuring out the ranges for each symbol much more tricky. Since you have a lot of chances, my suggested strategy is for the beginning of the game, mess around with clicking on all different symbols at least a few times each to get a sense of what the statistical ranges of what the symbols give you should be. Once you have a good sense, formulate a strategy where you choose the symbols that you expect to give you the biggest payout. There are definitely moments where you have to choose between two symbols that will give you negative payouts both, or ones where symbols will both give you around 0 to -1 points, so it's important to identify which symbols give you want in order to maximize your payout in the long run.

you will only be able to see a shape's value by selecting it and thus revealing that shapes value. The value of each shape will not change throughout the game but some shapes values will be more positive, whilst some other shapes will have a negative value e.g. -1, -8 etc

Your aim is to uncover and select the shapes to create the highest possible total value. 

One strategy to help would be to select each differing shape from one side of the screen (e.g. the left hand side shape) and make a mental note of the highest valued shape. Go through the collection of shapes and then begin to select the shape with the highest value  ","17:19:53"
"6658c8119af9537eefdfbde5","6658c8119af9537eefdfbde5","TEACH_RL_TEACHER_NoReversal_Pa","Ok so, I am another player who has just completed this task/game and now has to write out instructions for the next player (you!).. Sorry in advance if these instructions are crap.

In this task you have to pick between two different symbols by clicking on the one you want with your mouse. 
The symbols you choose will either: give rewards, minus rewards from you, or do nothing. 
You will see the outcome of your choice displayed below the symbol you choose when you click on it. You will only see the outcome of the symbol you chose - you will NOT see what the other symbol would have given you.

The original instructions I received before taking the task suggested that there would be some sort of identifiable strategy to this game and that I should pay attention to any patterns I noticed, but unfortunately, I didn't notice any particular patterns or identify a strategy! 
It came across as totally random to me:

My symbols were displayed in pairs and always appeared on screen in the SAME pairs, but sometimes the symbols had changed sides/swapped sides. The outcomes of choosing the same symbols changed and varied - no one symbol ALWAYS gave the same outcome, no matter which side it was on. 
I had one symbol in particular that paid out rather well most of the time - many times it would give me +10p, and sometimes it gave me +0p, but rarely did it give me minus points - so I just chose that one every time I saw it. 
There were a couple of other symbols like this that I identified, but they never gave the same outcome 100% of the time.

So my simple advice to you is to try and identify the symbols that MOST OFTEN give you plus points or zero points, and avoid any symbols that most often give you NEGATIVE points!

Good luck!","17:34:42"

Try to find out which symbol is consistently 10p and choose that whenever it comes up (for the first half anyway, and then it might change).  One symbol or colour might be consistently -10 and should be avoided.  After a while the symbols and their worth seem to change so if a previously  good one is now in the minus, try clicking the others instead.  I'm no expert but hopefully you'll learn better than me!","14:13:24"

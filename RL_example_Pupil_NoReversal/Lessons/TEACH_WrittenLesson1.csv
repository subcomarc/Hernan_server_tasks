After each selection you will be able to see how each shape scored in points and this will be your guide to choosing future shapes. One shape has the potential to give you more points than the other shape so it is imperative that you pay attention to the colour and form of the shape to learn which ones are more profitable. On occasion, both shapes will earn you a negative score and there is nothing that you can do about this.

In my experience, certain shapes were better at giving a consistently higher score such as the black shape and some gave a consistently negative score such as the mustard shape. In my game I made a correlation between shapes which had a gap running between them as they generally were better performers. However, you will soon learn the differences which are specific to your game and the quicker you make the links the better your overall score will be.",14:36:43

I analysed the scores relative to the colours, also a negative link. I analysed the scores for the left shape and the right shape to see if it was the placing rather than the shape that determined the score, but also no correlation. I also tried to see if symmetry in the shapes was reflected in the scores, but couldn't find a link there either.

I tried doing only left options for 5 or 6 times and then right or alternating but it makes no difference.  I maybe wouldn't think about it and just go with your gut instinct or the one you fancy.  Good Luck!",15:17:04

Some combinations when side by side =zero or both minus, but these were harder to remember and aren't worth worrying about if you forget. Just keep noting which ones you KNOW are winners  and click on them consistently. Good Luck, partner ! Win us both loads of cash :)",15:18:14

 I would advise not to seek after the points during the start of the game but rather watch out which shapes carry the points and use this as a great weapon in yourself in the long run. Basically, the things you should watch out for in other to not get confused is the color of the shapes that carry the most point whenever the answer is being revealed and store it in your brain as from here you would likely only have to input it in the upcoming guesses. For example, A certain shape has a yellow color and the points on it is 10, Anywhere that color or shape occurs, know it's repeated and go for it. 
So, from the start of the game take your time to know which shape comes and their points. And as well the position of the shape matters for some, You can note down the position where a shape is powerful and where it isn't.
This is just a quick guide of the test, Watch carefully from the start and gradually improve. Thank you.",15:25:06

Eg: graphic on the left is worth -1p, graphic on the right is worth 10p.

You will see different graphics from me, good luck",15:25:58

You will only see the reward attached to each symbol after choosing one of the pair and then you move on to the next pair. Each pair of symbols has different colors that will remain the same throughout, but the positions of the symbols might change during the experiment. 
Of the four pairs that are repeated throughout the experiment, two of them present symbol pairs that give the same reward (or slightly bigger when you choose the one on the right).
One of the four pairs also presents you with two symbols where one of them with a particular color is always the right option for the bigger reward.
The last one of the four pairs alternates the symbol that has better reward so you will have to guess and switch as the experiment goes on. You will have to find out which of the four pairs matches this description and then apply this strategy. Best of luck buddy.",15:55:43

But I'll advise you pick more of the characters in the right box. If you do that I think you should be able to accumulate a good amount of points.",15:59:09
